=Max ToolBox - Release notes=

==Version 14==
October 27th, 2009

  * Reworked colors in the help patch to make it compatible with object defaults (thanks to Pascal Baltazar)
  * Revamped the shortcut system, it's now possible to change all shortcuts and the letter. (not the ascii code) must be entered in the mtb_shortcuts.txt file, this should fix some compatibility issues with other third party packages.
  * Replaced the custom shell (shift-r function) by Max's dialog object.
  * Updated documentation

==Version b13==
September 25th, 2008

  * Changed the way the patch loads on startup :
  * There is now a single "Activate" checkbox in the ToolBox.maxpat patch (that is usually in the extras folder). Clicking the checkbox will activate the ToolBox. You can now close the ToolBox.maxpat patch and the ToolBox will remain active. To close the ToolBox, reopen the ToolBox.maxpat patch and deactivate the checkbox. If the checkbox is activated, the ToolBox will always load with Max, even if the ToolBox.maxpat patch is closed.
